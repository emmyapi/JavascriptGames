This repo is a collection of JavaScript games 

All games are so far a recreation of the games found in this course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFO_txvwK_c with only minor changes 

You can try them out by going to https://emmyapi.github.io/JavascriptGames/


I am not a software developer by profession. I have a Master's degree in Information Systems and Business Administration from Copenhagen Business School and work as an IT and business process consultant in a Microsoft-focused consultancy. These projects is an effort to become more familiar with JavaScript, and what better way than starting out with some fun games development. Next steps is to familiarize myself with React, Express.js, Next.js, and Node.js.
